Installation of datastore server
================================

Installation is automated using Ansible. The code for this
is stored in the publicdb repository. Specifically the
`datastore role <https://github.com/HiSPARC/publicdb/blob/master/provisioning/roles/datastore/tasks/main.yml>`_
contains the most relevant setup for the datastore server.

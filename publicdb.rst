Installation of public database server
======================================

Installation is automated using Ansible. The code for this
is stored in the publicdb repository. Specifically the
`publicdb role <https://github.com/HiSPARC/publicdb/blob/master/provisioning/roles/publicdb/tasks/main.yml>`_
contains the most relevant setup for the public database server.
